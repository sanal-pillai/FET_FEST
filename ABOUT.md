# Desk Finder

With the growth of the organizations, the property of the organizations also grows. So it becomes hard for someone to track a desk or find the specific meeting room. 

If it is in the same campus then also to find the exact tower location and to navigate to the required destination on the floor is a pain.

So that where the desk finder comes in, on entering the required location/desk, it would guide you to the required destination via 2D map as well Augmented Reality. 

Major help to techies who are always late for the meeting and then further spend time locating the meeting room.

We come from that school of techies who have this issue, so happy desk finding.
